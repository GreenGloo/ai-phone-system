## Technical Implementation

### ü§ñ AI Model Constraints

| Model | Max Tokens | Est. Max Words | Temperature | Actual Usage |
|-------|------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | 150 | ~115 words | 0.7 | ‚úÖ Well within limits |
| **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** | 200 | ~153 words | 0.7 | ‚úÖ Well within limits |

**Strategy**: "Balanced: fast but not truncated"
**Longest Response**: 33 words (service listing) - well under token limits

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

- **Response Timing**: 0.2-0.5 second delays (human-like, prevents hangup perception)
- **Parallel Processing**: Services and availability queries run simultaneously  
- **Caching**: Services cached for 5 minutes to reduce database queries
- **Database Storage**: Conversations stored in PostgreSQL with business isolation

### üé≠ Personality & Emotional Intelligence

**Available Personalities:**
- Professional & Warm (enthusiasm: 0.7, empathy: 0.8)
- Friendly & Approachable (enthusiasm: 0.9, empathy: 0.9)  
- Extremely Helpful (enthusiasm: 0.8, empathy: 0.9)

**Emotion Detection**: Analyzes customer speech for frustrated, urgent, happy, confused, or price-sensitive cues and adapts responses accordingly.

## Alternative Conversation Paths

### üîÄ Edge Cases and Extensions

| Scenario | Trigger | AI Response | Word Count |
|----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Name Collection** | Missing customer name | "Could I get your name for the appointment?" | 8 words |
| **Service Clarification** | Unclear service request | "I want to make sure I help you with exactly what you need. We offer: oil change, tire rotation, brake inspection, transmission service. Which of these sounds right for what you're looking for?" | 33 words |
| **Error Recovery** | System issues | "I'm having some technical difficulties, but I don't want to leave you hanging. Let me have someone call you back right away to make sure we take excellent care of you." | 32 words |
