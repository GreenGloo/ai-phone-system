# Twilio Webhook Configuration Fix

## Problem Summary
The Twilio webhook was configured incorrectly, causing the error:
```
ðŸ“ž Incoming call for business test: +15551234567 â†’ +18445401735
Database connection error: error: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "test"
```

## Root Cause
1. **Incorrect Webhook URL**: The Twilio phone number webhook was set to `/voice/incoming` instead of `/voice/incoming/{businessId}`
2. **Route Order Issue**: The catch-all route `/voice/*` was defined before the specific route, potentially interfering with routing

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Twilio Webhook URL
**Before**: `https://nodejs-production-5e30.up.railway.app/voice/incoming`
**After**: `https://nodejs-production-5e30.up.railway.app/voice/incoming/a67b205b-b5a3-450f-a2f4-1df340218b4c`

The webhook now includes the business UUID for the first business in the database (Childers Tax Preparation).

### 2. Fixed Route Order in app.js
Moved the catch-all route `/voice/*` to after the specific voice routes to prevent interference.

## Available Businesses
The database contains 4 businesses:
1. **Childers Tax Preparation** (a67b205b-b5a3-450f-a2f4-1df340218b4c) - **Currently Active**
2. AI Test HVAC Services (42875d4a-6423-4784-8993-906f510fb027)
3. CupcakesRus (8d68d767-95c3-44eb-a086-88d9b1093710)
4. Drug Testing LLC (3bc08026-a288-4d62-a9dd-c4ed36d803b3)

## Testing
Call **(844) 540-1735** to test the voice system. The call should now:
1. Route to the correct business context (Childers Tax Preparation)
2. No longer show the UUID parsing error
3. Properly handle the conversation flow

## Future Maintenance

### To Switch to a Different Business
```javascript
const twilio = require('twilio');
const twilioClient = twilio(process.env.TWILIO_SID, process.env.TWILIO_TOKEN);

// Get phone number
const phoneNumbers = await twilioClient.incomingPhoneNumbers.list();
const demoNumber = phoneNumbers.find(num => num.phoneNumber === '+18445401735');

// Update webhook to different business
await twilioClient.incomingPhoneNumbers(demoNumber.sid).update({
  voiceUrl: 'https://nodejs-production-5e30.up.railway.app/voice/incoming/NEW_BUSINESS_UUID',
  voiceMethod: 'POST'
});
```

### Multi-Business Setup (Production)
For a true multi-tenant setup, each business should have their own phone number. The current setup is demo/development friendly where all businesses share one number, but the webhook can only point to one business at a time.

## Files Modified
- `app.js` - Fixed route order (moved catch-all route after specific routes)
- Twilio webhook configuration updated via API

## Environment Variables Used
- `TWILIO_SID` - Twilio Account SID
- `TWILIO_TOKEN` - Twilio Auth Token  
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - The demo phone number (+18445401735)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
